I work at Teq as a Curriculum Specialist, and I am constantly looking for ways to further support teachers in integrating technology in their classrooms. I often attend Maker, Microsoft, Coding, and Google events and I am always educating myself in the newest technologies and trends such as pi-top and Maker Education.
When I am not attending educational technology events or working you can find me hiking a mountain, baking a cake,  running a 10k, or taking my dog, Bobo Manny (see photo),  for a walk.
I am excited to be a part of your Maker journey! If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me!<br><br></p>
